      <h2><center>Magawa's Extraordinary Life</center></h2>
      Magawa was an African giant pouched rat (Cricetomys gambianus) who was
      born in November 2013 at the APOPO headquarters in Morogoro, Tanzania.
      APOPO is a non-profit organization that trains African giant pouched rats
      to save lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis.
      <p>
        After being trained, he was moved to Siem Reap, Cambodia, in 2016 to
        begin landmine-removal work. From 2016 to 2021, Magawa cleared more than
        22.5 hectares (56 acres) of land in Cambodia. He was the most successful
        landmine-sniffing rat in the organization's history, and received the
        PDSA Gold Medal in 2020, the first rat ever to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Magawa retired from bomb sniffing in June 2021. He spent a number of
        weeks mentoring newly-recruited rats before retiring to a life of
        "snacking on bananas and peanuts". Magawa died peacefully in early
        January 2022.
